# Clouds 
Clouds represent the biggest source of uncertainty in climate response to CO$_2$ forcing. Of special concern are the stratocumulus decks found in the subtropics. Modeling their dynamics is challenging at scale, and so their behavior must be approximated in global models. Satellite observations provide an opportunity to learn about cloud physics, but represent a serious data challenge. 

## Temperature controls on low cloud morphology 
Using a self-supervised cloud classification system based on an auto-encoder, we can track cloud population dynamics.
