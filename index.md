## Pages and structure

Here are a few empty pages connecting to the menu links to show where files can go and the resulting paths. (It's probably best if you look at the source folder for this).

* [research](/menu1/)
* [publications](/menu2/)
* [talks](/menu3/)

## References (not really)

* \biblabel{noether15}{Noether (1915)} **Noether**,  Körper und Systeme rationaler Funktionen, 1915.

## Header and Footer

As you can see here at the bottom of the page, there is a footer which you may want on all pages but for instance you may want the date of last modification to be displayed.
In a fashion heavily inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), you can write things like

```html
Last modified: {{ fill fd_mtime }}.
```

(cf. `src/_html_parts/page_foot.html`) which will then replace these braces with the content of a dictionary of variables at the key `fd_mtime`.
This dictionary of variables is accessed locally by pages through `@def varname = value` and globally through the `config.md` page via the same syntax.

There's a few other such functions of the form `{{fname p₁ p₂}}` as well as support for conditional blocks. If you wander through the `src/_html_parts/` folder and its content, you should be able to see those in action.
