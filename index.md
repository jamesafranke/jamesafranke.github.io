I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago working with Greg Shakhnarovich. I used models, remote sensing, and deep learning to improve understanding about climate processes and impacts. I am also working on climate interventions.

# Active Projects

## Tracking global clound population changes following volcanic eruptions
Large volcanic eruptions are the best natural experiments we have to study the impact of stratospheric aerosol pertubations on the climate.

## Percieved SRM failure due to extremes following deployment
